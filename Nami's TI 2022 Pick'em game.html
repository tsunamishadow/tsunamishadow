    <p> <u><b>What do you mean by "a team that finishes below another team" and
          "top X (regardless of order)"?</b></u></p>
    <p> I understand this can be confusing so this will explain it. Imagine the
      table on the left is the result, and on the right is your prediction for a
      similar prediction game.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/381489278758289410/1027386835195940925/unknown.png"
        alt="An image showing the results of Group A from ESL1 Malaysia, and a prediction as an example."
        title="Prediction Example"></div>
    <p> For each team in your prediction, they are compared pairwise to each
      team above them. If the pairwise in your prediction matches the one in the
      final result, then you score a point. <br>
      So for Alliance, you score 5 points, since they are bottom and you placed
      them lower than each other team. <br>
      This is also true for Talon, 4 points for that. <br>
      For Entity, you would be correct for them finishing under Secret and
      Aster, but incorrect for finishing under Thunder Awaken. So 2 points for
      that. <br>
      Similarly for Thunder Awaken, you get 2 points. <br>
      Secret also scores a point.</p>
    <p> Then for top X, you score a point for each Top X (in this case until Top
      5) that is correct. <br>
      Top 1 is correct, Top 2 is correct, Top 3 is not, Top 4 is correct, and
      Top 5 is correct; as such you'll get 4 points.</p>
    <p>This is done specifically to benefit most predictions, since swapping a
      couple of teams - compared to the ending result - would not punish you as
      hard compared to most pick'em systems, which usually only care about
      placement.</p>
    <p>However if you do pick the group perfectly you will always score the full
      number of points, while picking the complete reverse order of them
      finishing scores you nothing.</p>
    <p>It sounds more confusing than it actually is, the <b>important thing is
        to think about where teams will place in comparison to others</b>,
      rather than just finishing place in the group.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Prizes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>$50 US Prize pool, paid via PayPal</li>
